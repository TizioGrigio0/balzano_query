# tizio_query
I've made this library to allow faster management of queries.
I will keep on updating this for a while, since it is currently really basic.

## How to use
Import the .inc file, then change the values of the variables (placed in the first 7 rows of the file):

$host = 'localhost';<br>
$password = '';<br>
$user = 'root';<br>
$db = 'tizio_dbName';<br>

If needed, override $conn using your own script.

## What it does
Allows to print in tables fast starting from queries, same goes for saving data starting from an array.
